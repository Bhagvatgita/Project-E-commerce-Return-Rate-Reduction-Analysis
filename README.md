## E-commerce Return Rate Reduction Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on identifying key reasons behind product returns in an e-commerce business and proposes actionable insights to reduce the return rate. We utilized Python for data analysis and, Power BI for visualization, and SQL for querying large datasets.

## Objective

- Analyze return rates across various categories.
- Identify factors that influence returns (e.g., product category, region, marketing channel).
- Predict which products are likely to be returned using a logistic regression model.
- Provide data-driven recommendations to reduce return rates.

## qqTools & Technologies

- **Python** (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- **Power BI**
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL)
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code**


## Tasks Performed

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Removed duplicates, null values, and irrelevant columns.
   - Standardized column names and formats.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed return rates by category, region, and channel.
   - Identified high-return product segments.

3. **Predictive Modeling (Python)**
   - Built a logistic regression model to predict return likelihood.
   - Exported a CSV file containing high-risk products for further review.

4. **Data Visualization (Power BI)**
   - Designed an interactive dashboard.
   - Included KPIs, bar charts, donut charts, line graphs, and drill-through filters.

## Key Insights

- Certain product categories had significantly higher return rates.
- Return rates were also influenced by specific marketing channels.

## Predictive Model Output

- Achieved a satisfactory accuracy 
- High-risk products exported as `high_risk_products.csv`.

## Conclusion
The project helped in:
- Pinpointing root causes of high return rates.
- Providing predictive insights to flag potential returns early.
- Recommending category-specific interventions to reduce return rates.
